### Background
The Wall Street crash of 1929 resulted in the creation of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in which its primary purpose was the following: facilitate capital formation, protect investors, and maintain fair and efficient markets. In order to achieve its mandate, SEC required publicly traded companies to submit quarterly and annual reports which are composed of financial statements along with management discussion and analysis. These financial statements are imperative to investors and creditors as it can provide an insight about a company's profitability, balance sheet, and ability to meet its short and long-term financial goals and obligations. Despite the accessibility of financial statements, there have been numerous well known corporations that have declared bankruptcy for various reasons. Hertz, J.C. Penny, and Mattress Firm are some of many companies that declared bankruptcy in 2020 which has resulted in many financial losses for investors and creditors. 

By having access to SEC reports, investors and creditors are able to extract financial information to determine ratios to give insight on a company's financial and operating performance. With the given financial metrics, the goal of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm which utilizes econometric and financial metrics to predict whether or not the corporation will go bankrupt (binary classification).
