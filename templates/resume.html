                <h2>Summary</h2>


<p>I graduated with a double major in accounting and finance from Roosevelt University which gave me a solid foundation of business fundamentals. In hopes of getting my CPA and fulfilling the 150 credit requirement, I decided to get my Master's in Data Science. Due to the technological advancements, data science has been a growing sector in which it uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. I hope to leverage the skills I learned in this program to enhance the accounting and financial sector.
